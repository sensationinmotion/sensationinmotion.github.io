## Opportunities to work in the lab
{:.center}
#### Undergraduate students

If you are an undergraduate student at SDSU interested in working in the lab, please get in touch. Depending on time and funding availability, volunteer and/or paid opportunities may be available. Please contact Dr. Reschechtko and be sure to briefly include the following information:

- Your expected year of graduation and major
- Your personal interests and goals, and how they relate to research in the lab
- A resume or CV



#### Currently enrolled Masters students

If you are a current masters student at in Exercise & Nutritional sciences at SDSU and you are interested in working in the lab, please get in touch -- ideally as early as possible during your studies. Because the M.S. program has limited time for research electives, it's helpful to plan as soon as possible!

#### Prospective M.S. students

If you are interested in pursuing a M.S. degree and working in the lab, we may be able to accept you through the [M.S. program in Exercise & Nutritional Sciences](https://ens.sdsu.edu/academic-programs/masters/), which offers M.S. degrees in Exercise Physiology, Nutrition, or a concurrent option through which students receive both Nutrition and Exercise Physiology M.S. degrees simultaneously. **Please contact Dr. Reschechtko prior to submitting your application** if working in the lab is your primary reason for applying to the program.

#### Ph.D. Students

At present, we are unable to support Ph.D. students. However, if you are a current Ph.D. at SDSU or another institution and interested the labs work, feel free to get in touch!

#### Postdoctoral Associates and Visiting Scholars

We currently do not have funding to support Postdoctoral fellows, however, if you are interested in applying for a postdoctoral grant to pursue research in the lab (e.g. through NIH or NSF, or an international funding agency), or have other means of external support, please do get in touch to discuss this possibility.
